# Password-Generator

For this assignment we had to create a password generator using an already-created html and css file by adding code to the js file.  While there were many ways to approach the task, I chose to build four initial arrays, then concatenate arrays to satisfy the 15 different cases that could occur based upon user input.

I prompted for a password length and created a "while" loop to account for the restrictions of no less than 8 and no more than 128 characters. Then I built "confirms" for the user to choose lower case, upper case, numeric, and/or special characters.

I then created a general array name called myArray, which was set equal to the specific array based upon the user choices using "if" statements.  Once my general array name was created, I wrote a loop to create the individual characters in the password string based upon which array was being used.

Finally, I returned the password back to the original code provided.  

I realized after the fact that this was very tedious and a great deal of extra steps for the coder. I could have made the four initial arrays, then concatenated arrays through a loop based on user choices to make a specific array.

Through this exercise I learned how to build arrays, how to concatenate, how to write conditions for "if" statements, how to write loops, and how to return a value to the code. That was quite a learning experience! I hope you enjoy my project!
